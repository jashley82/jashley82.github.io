title: Install Gnome Remove Unity
---

Gnome is cool. Let's install that.

```bash
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-gnome-desktop
```

Unity sucks.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get remove unity unity-asset-pool unity-control-center unity-control-center-signon unity-gtk-module-common unity-lens* unity-services unity-settings-daemon unity-webapps* unity-voice-service
```
