title: Configure SSH
---

SSH configuration is stored in the file ```/etc/ssh/sshd_config```.

####Disable password authentication.
Generate an SSH key for each computer that needs access.
```bash
ssh-keygen
```

Copy the contents of ```~.ssh/id_rsa.pub``` from each computer to ```~/.ssh/authorized_keys``` on the server. This can be accomplished manually or via
```bash
ssh-copy-id <server ip>
```

Now disable password access in the config file.

####Disable root login.
Disable root login in the config file. Root access is delegated by adding indiviual users to the sudo group.
```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo <username>
```

####Only allow SSHv2.
Previous versions are known to be insecure. Update the config file.
